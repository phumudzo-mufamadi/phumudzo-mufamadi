# 👋 Hi, I'm Phumudzo Mufamadi

A passionate QA engineer and aspiring full-stack developer, driven to build meaningful software and ensure top-tier quality through robust testing strategies.

## 🧪 Quality Assurance & Software Testing

Equipped with a National Diploma in IT and hands-on experience in both manual and automated testing. I leverage tools like Selenium, Postman, and pytest—along with ISTQB principles—to deliver efficient and reliable test coverage.

## 💻 Web Development & Programming

Skilled in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with growing experience in full-stack development using Django REST Framework, Flask, and FastAPI. I love bringing ideas to life through intuitive UIs and efficient backends.

## ⚙️ Tools & Tech

I thrive in Agile environments using Jira, Git, Jenkins, and BDD frameworks like Cucumber. I enjoy building web/mobile apps and dashboards that are as intuitive as they are impactful.

## 🚀 Growth & Collaboration

Always learning—working toward ISTQB certifications, exploring cloud technologies, and building tools with real-world value. Open to collaborations on educational platforms, open-source QA tools, or justice-oriented tech.

## ⚡ Fun Fact

When I'm not testing software or writing code, you'll find me lifting at the gym, growing things in the garden, or getting lost in a good book. I code best after a workout and a fresh idea. 😄
